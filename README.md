<h2>Attempting to find titanic sized prime numbers</h2>
<h3>Method</h3>
-Generate a list of all prime numbers from 3 to 999,999.<br>
-Multiply all the list elements together.<br>
-Subtract two from product <br>
<b>Problem:</b><br>
--The product of some lists requires either addition or subraction of 2 or 4 to achieve prime number.<br>
--I'm searching for a cyclic relationship/pattern between what number must be added/subtracted to the list-product and number of list elements or number of digits in list-product.
